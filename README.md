Step-by-Step Guide to Install and Deploy Vulnerable Code

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
    Install Python:

        Download and install Python from python.org.
        Ensure Python is added to your system PATH during installation.
        Verify the installation by running:
        python --version

    Install SQLite:
        SQLite is a lightweight database that comes pre-installed with Python. No additional installation is required.

Step 2: Create a Database and Table
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Create a new Python script to set up the database (grab the init_database.py and execute on your own server)
